# Machine Learning for Genomics and Therapeutics Resources

This repo accompanies our survey paper: 

[Machine Learning Applications for Therapeutic Tasks with Genomics Data. Kexin Huang*, Cao Xiao*, Lucas M. Glass, Cathy W. Critchlow, Greg Gibson, Jimeng Sun](https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.01171).

We list tools, algorithms, data for this area. Feel free to make a pull request for new resources.
